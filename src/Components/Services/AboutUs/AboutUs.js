      Classes are held on Saturdays, 9am to 6pm (generally) from September
      through to May. The program engages students with a comprehensive
      curriculum that demands a genuine commitment of time and energy. Learning
      piano is an area of particular focus here, with the Piano Performance
      Forum a requirement for all students majoring in piano and organ. This
      class introduces students to different keyboard instruments, an array of
      performance styles, and the opportunity to participate in masterclasses
      with both senior faculty and special guest artists.
